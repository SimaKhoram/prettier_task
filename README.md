# prettier_task

in this project, I tried to add the config of prettier which:

1. prints semicolons at the ends of statements,
2. Specified the line length on 80 so that the printer will wrap on at 80 character
3. will add "," after the last property in an object

Put html files on ignore so these configs will have no effect on them
and at the end added "Prettier - Code formatter" extention to run these configs automatically on save!
